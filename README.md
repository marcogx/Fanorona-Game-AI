Python GUI implementation of board game [Fanorona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanorona) between human and AI using [Alpha-Beta-Search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) and [Heuristics Evaluation Function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_%28computer_science%29). 

## Rules in Essence
1. The two players alternate their turns moving a piece from one intersection to an adjacent one along the indicated lines, starting with White.<br>
2. Capturing Move: move a piece toward/away an intersection adjacent to the opponent's piece; the opponent’s piece must lie along the line in the direction of the capturing piece’s move.
3. When an opponent’s piece is captured, all consecutive opponent pieces that lie along the line beyond that piece are captured as well.
4. Capturing moves are mandatory and have to be played in preference to non-capturing moves.
